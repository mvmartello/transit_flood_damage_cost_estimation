Notes: 

- A portion of the required data is subject to a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and is therefore not included here. More specifically, the SWMM input file for the MBTA system (Root.inp) contains sensitive data subject to an NDA.
- This code (specifically the run.bat file) requires installation of Command Line SWMM for successful completion.
- This code requires the ability to run python scripts (execute .py files)

How to use this code:

Dxx.csv files contain water surface elevation time series data for SWMM model junctions based on Massachusetts Coastal Flood Risk Model (MC-FRM) data

Run "CSV to DAT2.py" to convert these Dxx.csv files into the appropriate number .DAT files. These serve as input for EPA SWMM input files. 
Run "Editing INP File3.py" to generate appropriate EPA SWMM files based on the "Root.inp" template. This code also organizes the files into separate folders for each coastal flood scenario.
Run the "run.bat" file to execute Command Line SWMM for each coastal flood scenario.
Run "report to CSV.py" to convert the EPA SWMM output files to a .csv format for further processing in the Hydraulic Results Viewer.
